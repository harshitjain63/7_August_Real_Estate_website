        <p>Founded in 1946 by Chaudhary Raghvendra Singh, DLF started with the creation of 22 urban colonies in Delhi.
            In 1985, the company expanded into the then-unknown region of Gurugram, creating exceptional living and
            working spaces for the new Indian global professionals. Today, DLF is the largest publicly listed real
            estate company in India, with residential, commercial, and retail properties in 15 states and 24 cities.</p>
        <p>Our diverse verticals reflect our dedication to developing ecosystems for India’s changing needs. But our
            foundation has always been our employees, our customers, our stakeholders, and our shareholders. We invest
            in spearheading innovation through empowerment and optimism, in order to build the foundation of India’s
            future on the legacy of our past.</p>
